# 🚇 Tashkent Metro Routing Engine

A **backend-driven metro routing engine** that models the Tashkent Metro system as a graph and computes routes between stations using graph traversal algorithms (specifically BFS).

This project focuses on **systems thinking, algorithms, and backend architecture**. It is designed to demonstrate how real-world transit systems can be modeled, queried, and exposed via clean APIs.

> ⚠️ **Project Status:** In progress
> * MySQL schema and Node.js async queries designed and hosted 
> * Core routing logic implemented using **BFS**
> * Transfer weighting and time-based optimization planned
> * Frontend visualization planned

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Model a real metro system as a **graph** (stations + connections)
* Implement **route-finding algorithms** (starting with BFS)
* Design a **scalable backend API** that can support a frontend
* Practice clean backend architecture using real data constraints
* Showcase algorithmic thinking beyond CRUD applications

## 🧠 High-Level System Design

The system is intentionally split into **three layers**:

1. **Database Layer** – stores metro topology
2. **Backend Layer** – routing engine + API
3. **Frontend Layer (planned)** – user interaction & visualization

## 🗄️ Database Design (MySQL)
* **Stations** → nodes in the graph
* **Connections** → edges between stations
* **Lines** → metadata used for future transfer logic

### Example Tables

```sql
Stations(id, name, line)
Connections(station_a, station_b)
```

This schema allows the backend to build an **adjacency list** for graph traversal dynamically.

## ⚙️ Backend Architecture

**Stack:**
* React.js (planned)
* Node.js
* Express
* SQL
* MySQL

### Key Responsibilities

* Fetch metro data from the database
* Build an **in-memory graph representation**
* Execute routing algorithms
* Return routes via REST endpoints

### Routing Engine

* Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
* Guarantees the **minimum number of stops**
* Clean separation between:

  * Data fetching
  * Graph construction
  * Algorithm execution

> Future versions will introduce **weighted routing** (e.g. transfer penalties, travel time).
